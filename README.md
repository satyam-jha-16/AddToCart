# AddToCart
Description:
Add to Cart is based no the concept of TO-Do wherein one can write off the items you want to buy and when you actually buy it off , One just needs to tap on the displayed item and it fades away

Motivation behing this app:
I tend to forget things pretty easily so for me its a game changing product that I don't have to remember the items I have to buy 

Learings I got during it's creation:
>FLex Properties in CSS
>FireBase Realtime Database connectivity to the JS
>worked in the Fav Icon for first time
>Learnt about making mobile friendly app
